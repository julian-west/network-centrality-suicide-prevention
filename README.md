Project completed as part of the Imperial College Business School MSc Business Analytics course. Developing a custom centrality measure to identify important members of a social network and their influence over others in the network.


### Brief
> A high-school Suicide and Distress Counseling service has data on the phone calls between 27 high-school students (a who-talks-to-whom network). One of its directors believes network analytics will help it proactively monitor and help students in distress.<br><br>
One of the concerns in sociology of young adults is the prevalence of suicide-pacts between pairs of friends. The Director wants to come up with a measure so that if they identify a person as potentially troubled, they can identify a “paired” subject that they can reach out pro-actively to assess suicide risk. It is known that potential at-risk students become increasingly withdrawn<br><br>
Given this information, develop a centrality measure which identifies the most at risk students in the network.
